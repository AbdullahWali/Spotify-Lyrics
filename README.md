# Spotify Lyrics
Hello music lovers, this tool will fetch the lyrics for the song you're currently playing on spotify and display it on a webpage. Once you change the song you're currently playing, simply refresh the page and you'll instantly get the lyrics of the new song being played. You don't have to use your PC to play the music, you can use spotify on your phone and the tool will still detect the song as long as your phone is connected to the internet.
